# Normalize line endings to reduce noisy diffs and prevent devcontainer rebuild prompts
# caused by CRLF/LF flip-flopping across environments.

# Keep shell scripts consistent
*.sh text eol=lf

# Keep JSON/YAML consistent (devcontainer + workflows)
*.json text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf

# Devcontainer configs should always be LF
.devcontainer/* text eol=lf
.vscode/* text eol=lf
