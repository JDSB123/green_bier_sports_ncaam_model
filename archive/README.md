# Archived root scripts

These scripts were legacy/one-off and removed from the active root:
- analyze_backtest_results.py (hardcoded backtest CSV, manual analysis)
- capture_closing_lines.py (ad-hoc closing line capture; Odds API key required)
- deploy_to_azure.py (old governance/canonical blob deploy)
- sync_canonical_master.py (manual Azure sync helper)

Restore only if you have a specific need; they are unsupported by the current workflow.
